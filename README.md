## (almost) Solo Project

This is a personal project made mostly by me — development, and testing.  
I’m using it to level up my game dev skills and explore what Godot can do.
The levels are all designed by my girlfriend (except the tutorial ones).
(none of which I have yet implemented, but I will soon enough)
